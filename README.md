# Description

This is my how personal message board that I have created with my own frontend as well as backend. It works using (Vite+React) and (NodeJs/ExpressJS). It is a place where people can come in and write their own messages and discuss.

# Improvements

One of the improvements I believe I could make would be to add authentication to allow verified users to write their own messages

# Difficulties

This is my third project using Vite and I have become quite comfortable with it.

# Technologies

(JavaScript)

# Frontend

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh

- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

# Backend

- (NodeJs + ExpressJs)[https://expressjs.com/en]
- (MongoDB + Mongoose)[https://mongoosejs.com/docs/]
